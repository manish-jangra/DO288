### Source-to-Image Builds
DevOps --> reduce time to market

Source to Image 

ðŸ‘‰ Automatic Language Detection (OpenShift Special)

Builder Image Stream points to builder image (Application runtime + common dependencies for runtime)

Scripts: 

    ðŸ‘‰  assemble --> builds application using source code

    ðŸ‘‰  run --> sets the entrypoint for the application

    ðŸ‘‰  save-artifacts --> saves build dependencies and recycles them next time when we build application (oc start-build)
