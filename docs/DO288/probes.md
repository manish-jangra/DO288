## OpenShift (Kubernetes) Probles

1. Startup Probe
2. Readiness Probe
3. Liveness Probe

#### Startup Probe
A startup probe verifies whether the application within a container is started. Startup probes run before any other probe, and, unless it finishes successfully, disables other probes. If a container fails its startup probe, the container is killed and will follow the pod's restartPolicy.

This type of probe is only executed at startup, unlike readiness probes, which are run periodically. The startup probe is configured in the **spec.containers.startupprobe** attribute of the pod configuration.

#### Readiness Probe
Readiness probes determine whether or not a container is ready to serve requests. If the readiness probe returns a failed state, Red Hat OpenShift removes the IP address for the container from the endpoints of all services.

>**trick**
Developers can use readiness probes to signal to Red Hat OpenShift that even though a container is running, it should not receive any traffic from a proxy. This can be useful for waiting for an application to perform network connections, loading files and cache, or generally any initial tasks that might take considerable time and only temporarily affect the application.

#### Liveness Probe
Liveness probes determine whether or not an application running in a container is in a healthy state. If the liveness probe detects an unhealthy state, Red Hat OpenShift kills the container and tries to redeploy it.

The liveness probe is configured in the spec.containers.livenessprobe attribute of the pod configuration

**Red Hat OpenShift provides five options that control these probes:** ðŸ‘‡

| Name               | Mandatory  | Description                                                                                               | Default Value |
| -------------------| -----------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| initialDelaySeconds| Yes        | Determines how long to wait after the container starts before beginning the probe.                        |     0         |
| timeoutSeconds     | Yes        | Determines how long to wait for the probe to finish. If this time is exceeded, probe fails.               |     1         |
| periodSeconds      | No         | Specifies the frequency of the checks.                                                                    |     1         |
| successThreshold   | No         | Specifies the minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after it has failed.|     1         |
| failureThreshold   | No         | Specifies the minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after it has succeeded.  |     3         |

### **Methods of Checking Application Health** ðŸ‘‡
#### HTTP Checks
An HTTP check is ideal for applications that return HTTP status codes, such as REST APIs. HTTP probe uses GET requests to check the health of an application. The check is successful if the HTTP response code is in the range 200-399.

```YAML
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  timeoutSeconds: 1
```

#### Container Execution Checks
Container execution checks are ideal in scenarios where you must determine the status of the container based on the exit code of a process or shell script running in the container. When using container execution checks, Red Hat OpenShift executes a command inside the container. Exiting the check with a status of 0 is considered a success. All other status codes are considered a failure

```YAML
livenessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - cat
    - /tmp/health
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  timeoutSeconds: 1
```
#### TCP Socket Checks
A TCP socket check is ideal for applications that run as daemons, and open TCP ports, such as database servers, file servers, web servers, and application servers.

When using TCP socket checks, Red Hat OpenShift attempts to open a socket to the container. The container is considered healthy if the check can establish a successful connection

```YAML
livenessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  timeoutSeconds: 1
```

#### Set probes using command line
    oc set probe deployment myapp --liveness --get-url=http://:8080/healthz --initial-delay-seconds=30 --timeout-seconds=2
    oc set probe deployment myapp --liveness --get-url=http://:8080/ready --initial-delay-seconds=30 --timeout-seconds=2
